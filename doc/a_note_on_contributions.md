Project 4: Collaborative Filtering Algorithm

Summary: In this project, we implemented and compared algorithms from the collaborative filtering literature on two datasets â€“ Microsoft anonymous website data and EachMovie data.

We applied different variants of similarity weighting, which include Spearman, Entropy (empirical KL-Divergence), Mean Squared Difference, and SimRank. Additional adjustments, including Significance Weighting, Variance Weighting, Combined Selected Neighbors, and Ratio Normalization with Z-score, are applied.  In addition, we have cross-validated C for the number of clusters.
